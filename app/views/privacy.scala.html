                <h3>Who Are We</h3> 
                <p>This Privacy Policy sets out the basis on which the personal data we collect about you, or that you provide to us, will be used by us. Please read the following carefully to understand our views and practices regarding your personal data and how we will treat it.</p>
                <h3>What Personal Data Do We Collect?</h3> 
                <p>The personal data that we collect when you visit our Sites or use our Services, may include the following:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><i>Information you provide to Lightbend</i> - we collect data that you choose to provide to us when you are using our Services and that can be used to contact or identify you. Personal data may include your name and email address.</li>
                    <li><i>Information automatically collected</i> - whenever you visit or interact with the Sites, we automatically collect data about your visit. Such information includes your computer's Internet Protocol ("IP") address, browser type, browser version, the pages you visit, the time and date of your visit, the time spent on those pages and other statistics. We gather such information through cookies and other web technologies. See also 'The use of cookies' to find out more.  Lightbend Services do not automatically collect personal data.             </li>
                    <li><i>Information from third parties</i> - Sometimes the Sites may permit interactions with third-party websites, such as Google Analytics that collect, monitor and analyze this type of information in order to increase our Services' functionality.</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Purposes For Which We Use Personal Data</h3>
                <p>We collect and use your personal data for the purposes described below and on the following lawful bases:<p>
                <ul>
                    <li><i>For the performance of our agreement with you</i> - We collect personal data for the purpose of providing the Services, in order to manage and handle your purchase orders, for the purpose of identifying and communicating with you and to respond to your requests or inquiries.</li>
                    <li><i>For our legitimate interests as a business when those interests are not overridden by your interests, fundamental rights or freedoms</i> - Our legitimate interests to analyse visits to and use of the Sites to improve and develop our Services as well as to understand our customers both on aggregated and on individual basis. This also means that we analyse your use of Services and use this information to improve our Services and to give you a better experience (e.g. we analyse what webpages you visit, which Services you use and like and how you use these Services, which enables us to create personal profiles and to assess what may be interesting to you, which recommendations we can give you when you purchase our Services). Creating such personal profiles of our customers, enables us to send you marketing materials that directly relate to your use of Services, if you have chosen to receive such materials. With respect to our customers who purchased one of our Services, we may send marketing material regarding similar Services. We may also enrich your personal data to ensure the security of our Services; to prevent fraud, hacking, cheats and spamming; and to facilitate our response to legal processes (e.g., a court order, warrant or subpoena).</li>
                    <li><i>Based on your consent</i> - We use your personal data based on your consent when you sign up to receiving our newsletters, marketing or promotion material and other information that may be of interest to you through our Sites or otherwise expressly consent to the use of your personal data. You can withdraw your consent at any time by sending an email to <a href="mailto:privacy@@lightbend.com">privacy@@lightbend.com</a> or by opting-out by following the opt-out instructions in the relevant marketing communication.</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Who We Share Your Personal Data With</h3> 
                <p>We do not share your personal data other than described in this paragraph:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><i>Service Providers and processors</i> - We engage third party companies, individuals and affiliated entities to facilitate our Services and to provide the Services on our behalf, to perform Service-related services, to assist us in analysing how our Services are used, data storage and other services. These third parties have access to your personal data only to perform specific tasks on our behalf and are obligated not to disclose or use your information for any other purpose.</li>
                    <li><i>Third parties in case of legal requirement</i> - We will also disclose your  personal data if we believe we are required to do so by law, or that doing so is reasonably necessary to comply with legal processes; when we believe necessary or appropriate to disclose personal data to law enforcement authorities, such as to investigate actual or suspected fraud or violations of law or breaches of security; to respond to any claims against us; and, to protect the rights, property, or safety of Lightbend, our customers, or the public.</li>
                    <li><i>Third parties with consent</i> - We will also disclose information about you, including personal data to any other third parties, where you have expressly consented or requested that we do so.</li>

                <h3>Security</h3>
                <p>In order to protect your personal data we have implemented reasonable, commercially acceptable security procedures and practices appropriate to the nature of the personal data we store, in order to protect it from unauthorized access, destruction, use, modification or disclosure. Your personal data is contained behind secured networks and is only accessible by a limited number of people, who have special access rights and are required to keep the information confidential.</p>
                <p>Please keep in mind that no website or internet transmission is completely secure. Therefore, we cannot guarantee that unauthorized access, hacking, data loss, or other breaches will never occur. We urge you to take steps to keep your personal data safe, such as closing your web browser when finished using the Sites.</p>

                <h3>Children Under The Age Of 16</h3>
                <p>Our Services do not typically address anyone under the age of 13. Therefore, we do not knowingly request or collect personal data from children younger than 13 years of age, without parental consent. If you believe that we may have unintentionally collected personal data from a child under 13, please contact us (see below 'How you cancontact us') so that we may take appropriate steps to delete such information.</p>
                <p>If you are at least 13 years of age but under the age of 16, we need the consent of your parent or legal guardian before you give us any personal data about yourself.</p>

                <h3>Use Of Cookies</h3>
                <p>We and our third party providers use cookies, clear GIFs/pixel tags, JavaScript, local storage, log files, and other mechanisms to automatically collect and record information about your browsing activities, and use of the Services. We may combine this “activity information” with other personal data we collect about you where permitted by law.</p>  
                <p>Generally, we use this activity information to understand how our Services are used, track bugs and errors, improve our Services, verify account credentials, allow logins, track sessions, prevent fraud, and protect our Services, as well as for targeted marketing and advertising, to personalize content and for analytics purposes.  For more detailed information about these mechanisms and how we collect activity information, see our <a href="/cookie">Cookie Policy.</a><p>

                <h3>Data Retention</h3>
                <p>We will generally retain the personal data we processed through our Sites and Services for as long as it is required for purposes for which the data were collected.

                <h3>International Transfers</h3>
                <p>Your personal data may be transferred to -and maintained on- computers located outside of your state, province, country or governmental jurisdiction where the data protection laws may differ than those from your jurisdiction.
